The Web is widely regarded as a universal multi-media platform. Yet, it still
lacks a common model for timing and media control. The motion model promises
to fill this gap, and indicates a significant potential for the Web as a
platform for globally synchronized capture and playback of timed multimedia.
To bring these possibilities to the attention of the Web community, the motion
model has been proposed for Web standardization. The Multi-device Timing
Community Group (MTCG)~\cite{mtcg} has been created to attract support for
this initiative. The MTCG has published the draft specification for the 
TimingObject~\cite{timingobject}. It has also published Timingsrc~\cite{timingsrc}, an open
source JavaScript implementation of the TimingObject specification, including
timing objects, timing converters, sequencers and the mediaSync library.

Though the ideas promoted by the MTCG have been received with enthusiasm by
members within the W3C and within the wider Web community, at present the MTCG
proposal has not been evaluated by the W3C.
