	LOCAL WRAPPER

	Update requests are cached locally, visible to the query
	operation, thus allowing them to take effect immediately
	(speculatively).

	This allows as remote timing object to emulate the low latency of a local timing object.

	A timeout clears the speculative internal vector after some time,
	unless a change notification is received in the mean time.

	NO SUPPORT for STREAMING updates. 
	- This implementation is simple, and does not provide support
	for streaming updates.

	This would require the ability to bind update request to update notification, and to have this
	supported by the timing provider.
