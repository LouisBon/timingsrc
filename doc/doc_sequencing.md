With the _Sequencer_ an interval on the timeline is active whenever it covers the moving position of the timing object. The _IntervalSequencer_ uses two timingobjects to define a moving interval. An interval on the timeline is active whenever it is fully or partially covered by the moving interval of the _IntervalSequencer_.
